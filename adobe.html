        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
            During the summer of 2016, I interned at Adobe Research in the Creative Technologies Lab. Within the CTL, I worked closely with the Scout team to explore the (still under the works) idea of a "creative concierge" platform.
        </p>

        <h3>Problem</h3>

        <p>
            I ended up dividing the problem into three different points:
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Creative needs vs. Time and/or Skills </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Mostly everyone has creative needs. That being said, not everyone has the capacity to fulfill those needs by themselves; working parents might not have the time, and specialized real estate aents may not have the technical skills to work with creative software like Photoshop, Lightroom, and	Illustrator.  
            As a workaround to these obstacles, many people resort to "creative concierge"type platforms, whereby a creative request is fulfilled by some third party (usually a creative professional)for a hefty amount of money. Examples of such platforms are Fiverr, Dribbble, and	99Designs. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Back and forth communication is inefficient </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            One common problem that current platforms fail to address is the inefficiency of a back and forth communication. Upon fulfillment of a creative request, it's pretty common for the client to not be 100 percent satisfied - and to make additional requests and clarifications to the creative professional, resulting in increasingly long email chains, time spent on a single project, and work on the creative professional's part. Thinking on a broader scale, these inefficiencies would hinder the ability of any creative concierge product to scale to larger	degrees.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Less user control = Less creative involvement </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Past HCI work has shown that giving control leads to greater feelings of creative empowerment and involvement. In a transactional-based platform at a company whose biggest commodity is creativity, how do we preserve feelings of creative control and empowerment?
        </p>

        <p>
            So - if we constrain communication to a one-way communication (i.e. someone makes a request, someone fulfills the request, and that's it), how much control can we give to users such that they feel 1) satisfied and 2) creatively	empowered?
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
            How can we maximize	usersâ€™ creative	empowerment and	satisfaction in a one-way communication system?	
        </div>

        <h3>Experiment 1</h3>

        <p>
            Through a combination of focus groups and personal experiences, I identified a general process that requesters (i.e. people who make requests for creative products) follow:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Pre-request:</b> typically, there's some sort of form involved. The user chooses whatever it is they want to be fulfilled, uploads necessary photos, types in comments, etc. before hitting "request" or	"submit"</li>
            <li><b>Request:</b> the point at which the "request" button is clicked</li>
            <li><b>Post-request:</b> the point at which the request has been made and the creative professional fulfills it</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The first question I set out to answer was how the timing of control affected users' satisfaction and feelings of creativity, if at	all.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
            How does giving no control v.s. control before v.s. after a request impact users' satisfaction and creative empowerment?
        </div>

        <p>
            To answer this question, I programmed up a simple web page with the following flow:
        </p>
        
    </div>

        <img src="adobe/adobe1.png" class="medImage">
    
    <div class="section">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
            Upon selecting one of four pre-chosen photos and an effect to apply to it, users would be directed to one of four different	pages:
        </p>

        <ol type="a"> 
            <li><b>No control:</b> Users receive the final edited image with the effect at 100%	intensity </li>
            <li><b>Pre-request control: </b>Users choose the intensity of the image prior to it being returned</li>
            <li><b>Post-request discrete control: </b>Users receive several edited images at varying intensities and choose the one that they prefer</li>
            <li><b>Post-request continuous control:</b> Users receive the final edited image along with a slider to change the intensity	level</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            At the end of the webpage, users answered statements by showing their agreement with statements like "The image looked exactly how I expected it to look" and "I am creative" in Likert type	format:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <img src="adobe/adobe2.png" class="medImage">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
            I put the website on Amazon Mechanical Turk and gathered results from approximately 350 subjects over the course of several	days.
        </p>

        <H3>Experiment 1 Results</H3>

        <p>
            I observed three key things: 
        </p>

        <ol> 
            <li>Any control > no control to increase satisfaction</li> 
            <li>Any control > no control to meet users' expectations</li>
            <li>Any control > no control to increase feelings of control and creative involvement </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The findings were based on several ANOVA tests run, and the 95 percent confidence intervals that were constructed from the data. While for a first experiment it certainly seemed like any control was always beneficial, I wanted to make sure that these results would hold true even when users edited their own personal images, rather than a pre-selected image that they have no personal attachment	to. 
        </p>

        <h3>Experiment 2</h3>

        <div class="quote">
            Do the same results hold when users are editing	their own	personal images?
        </div>

        <p>
            I modified the website to allow users to upload their own images, preserving all other aspects of the experiment	setup:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <img src="adobe/adobe4.png" class="medImage"> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Experiment 2 Results</h3>

        <p>
            Overall, the results from experiment 2 supported the original findings in experiment 1:
        </p>

        <img src="adobe/adobe51.png" class="medImage"><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <img src="adobe/adobe52.png" class="medImage">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <img src="adobe/adobe53.png" class="medImage">
    <p>&nbsp;   </p>
        <p>
            After confirming that user behavior did not change depending on ownership of the edited image, I also wanted to see whether behavior would change when more complex effects (i.e. effects not easily reproducible on one's own) were given. Additionally, on a more UI-facing perspective, I was curious as to whether there was a difference in satisfaction and creativity when users were gieven discrete or continuous	control.
        </p>

        <h3>Experiment 3</h3>

        <div class="quote">
            Do the same results hold when users are selecting more complex	effects?
        </div>

        <div class="quote"> 
            How do	continuous vs. discrete			
            controllers impact satisfaction and creative empowerment?
        </div>

        <p>
            I preserved the initial approach but replaced the simpler effects with more complex ones, and I changed the interface of the discrete controller to match the continuous controller. Now, they both look like sliders; the former snaps to interval tick marks while the latter is a spectrum.

            After collecting results, it was easy to compare all experimental results together in a single	table:

            <b>Post-request control is more favorable than Pre-request control, which is roughly equivalent to giving no control</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Based on the data and written feedback, it was observed that the primary reason why users were ever dissatisfied with an edited image differed between those who had pre-control and those with post-control. For users who were given control before the request had been fulfilled, a significant number of people said that they wished they had been given control after the image was returned (i.e. pre-control users wanted post-control). On the other hand, post-control users simply said they wished they had been given even more control.

        <p>
            <b>Tradeoff between satisfaction and creative empowerment through	control</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            As we had intuitively reasoned earlier on, there is indeed a significant tradeoff between a user's satisfaction level with the final edited image, the creative process, and their feelings of creative involvement. Creating an Adobe product that both satisfies users and creatively empowers them will be a process of determining the opportunity costs and pros and cons of prioritizing one over the	other.
        </p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>

        <p>
            A paper and a poster at CHI may or may not be on the horizon. I'm also interested in exploring and quantifying exactly at what point the amount of control given to a user will begin negatively impacting satisfaction (i.e. 35 sliders for a single image edit). It'd also be good to verify these results again through different user interfaces.
        </p>

        <p>
            Happy to say that my research has also been used to inform the design of Adobe's creative concierge idea and Adobe Post / Spark!
