                        <h1>Traffic Light Redesign Experiments</h1>
I was driving the other day when, at an intersection, two questions came to mind: 
<ul>
                       <li>Do colorblind people have trouble distinguishing trafflic light signals? </li>
                       <li>Why are traffic lights displayed in colored <i>circles</i> ? </li></ul>
To address the first question, prevailing opinion seems to agree that while colorblind people sometimes do have trouble distinguishing between the red, yellow, and green lights, it is universally known (and even more so understood) that the order of lights goes R - Y - G from top to bottom and left to right. <p>
With regards to the shape of traffic lights themselves, it turns out that they were originally circles due to engineering constraints (something about flourescent lightbulbs being used) which is an outdated problem. So it's not <i>strictly</i> necessary to have circular traffic lights anymore. </p>
