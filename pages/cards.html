            <p>
                As a fun exercise in interface design and protoyping, I decided to design and prototype three different interfaces using Axure. 
            </p>

            <h3>Exercise Intro</h3>
            
            <div align="center">
                <img style="width:60%" src="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/wih1jwvgy1mhf9oaanxc.jpg">

            <p>
                In the 2013 movie <i>Her</i>, set in the near future, the main character Theodore's job is to <b>write "personal" cards on behalf of other people</b> - who are presumably too busy to write their own (i.e. Happy Birthday, Mom! Congrats on Graduation, Bobby!). 
            </p>

            <p>
                For this exercise, we'll imagine that an 'outsourced card corporation like that exists today, called <i>A Personable Touch</i> (APT for short). They use specific card making software, CardMaker Pro (CMP), to create cards. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The process that APT writers use to write cards is as follows: 

            <ol>
                <li>They open up two separate CMP files (each of which has its own window) side-by-side:</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>One empty file for the new card they've been tasked to write</li>
                    <li>One archived card on a similar topic. They use this second card in two ways:</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>They copy-paste choice phrases from it into the new card and</li>
                        <li>They look at the second card for inspiration</li>
                    </ol>

                </ol>

            </ol>
            </p>

        <h3>Exercise</h3>

        The things to address were: 

        <ul>
            <li>What were the intended goals of the original software?</li>
            <li>Make two or three new designs for new interfaces which might support the use cases the APT writers described in addition to the intended advantages of v2</li>
            <li>Anayze the results and decide which design should be picked for the APT writers and other potential user populations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Initial Assumptions</h3>

        <p>
            I decided to approach the problem by first identifying the constraints and assumptions I would be making, which would form the scope that I would be working in 
        </p>

        <b>The Card Structure</b>
        <p>
            A cards of two key components:
        <ol>
            <li>The written content</li>
            <li>The design (images, formatting, etc.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <b>The Process</b>
        <p>
            As observed from APT writers' interactions with CMP 1.0, there are two distinct flows that can be taken to create a new card:
        <ol>
            <li>Refer to archived cards for recyclable content and design inspiration</li>
            <li>Create original content adn design from scratch</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <b>APT Writers</b>
        <p>
            Writers are expected to produce as many new cards as is feasible in a given day. Additionally, APT emphasizes content consistency across all of its cards in order to maintain branding cohesion. As such, APT writers have the following goals:
        <ul>
            <li>Minimize time and effort spent on creating written content</li>
            <li>Maintain content quality and consistency</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Process 1 (using archived cards) requires less time and effort than Process 2. Additionally, copying and pasting choice phrases from archived content ensures some degree of similarity and consistency between the new card and its predecessors. As a result, APT writers will look at old cards for inspiration and convenience rather than creating radically new content. This conclusion about user behavior is confirmed by the writers’ observed use of CMP 1.0.
        </p>

        <b>CMP 1.0</b>
        <p>
            I will assume – based on the observed behaviors of the APT writers using CMP 1.0, the time allotment for an APT writer’s card-making process when using CMP 1.0:
        <ul>
            <li>Content creation (5 mins)</li>
            <li>Design (15 mins)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            This results in 20 minutes per card. If an APT writer works a normal nine hour workday, he or she can be expected to produce around 25 cards in a day.
            <ul>
                <li>APT writers have used CMP 1.0 for a significantly long period of time</li>
                <li>Full-screen is not an option on CMP 1.0</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <b>CMP 2.0</b>
        <p>
            It will be assumed that:
        <ul>
            <li>Only one half of one card can be displayed at a time, on the current software.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, time allotent for the card-making process using CMP 2.0 is:
            <ul>
                <li>Content creation (10 mins)</li>
                <li>Design (15 mins)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            This results in a total of 25 minutes per card. If an APT writer works a normal nine hour workday, he or she can be expected to produce around 20 cards in a day, or five less than he or she would normally produce.
        </p>

        <h3>CMP 2.0 Intended Goals</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Economize the workspace</b></li>
            By only showing one half of the card at a time, the active half can be displayed on a larger scale adn minute details are easily visible.
            <li><b>Simplify the workspace</b></li>
            Because only a single card and window is displayed at a time, there is no redundancy / duplication of tools by having multiple copies of the same taskbar for individual cards. Additionally, by only showing one half of the card at a time, attention is focused on the task at hand (content creation OR design)
        </ol>

        <h3>Brainstorming</h3>

        <p>
        From the initial persona and understanding of APT writers, I was able to draw out use case diagrams for a card-making software that they would be able to use. 
        </p>

        <div align="center">
            <img style="width:60%; " src="cards/useCase.png">
        </div>

        <p>
            I then began iterating on potential interface designs for the software. There was a lot of experimentation with having unfolded vs. folded cards, understanding the affordances that certain visual objects might present, and spending some time thinking about the micro-interactions that users will encounter.

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Different interfaces work better for different user froups depending on their capabilities an natural behaviors</li>
            <li>A lot of intuitive design is based on natural occurences; that being said, there's also a lot of intuitive design that comes from convention of design from past products, and thus is reinforced through others also adopting the design convention</li>
