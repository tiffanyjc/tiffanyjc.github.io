            <h2>i.e. how to make people feel in control when we don't (want to) give them control</h2>
            
            <p>
                During the summer of 2016, I interned at Adobe Research in the Creative Technologies Lab. Within the CTL, I worked closely with the Scout team to explore the (still under the works) idea of a "creative concierge" platform.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            
            <p>
                I ended up dividing the problem into three different points:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Creative needs vs. Time and/or Skills </b>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Mostly everyone has creative needs. That being said, not everyone has the capacity to fulfill those needs by themselves; working parents might not have the time, and specialized real estate aents may not have the technical skills to work with creative software like Photoshop, Lightroom, and	Illustrator.  
                As a workaround to these obstacles, many people resort to "creative concierge"type platforms, whereby a creative request is fulfilled by some third party (usually a creative professional)for a hefty amount of money. Examples of such platforms are Fiverr, Dribbble, and	99Designs. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Back and forth communication is inefficient </b>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                One common problem that current platforms fail to address is the inefficiency of a back and forth communication. Upon fulfillment of a creative request, it's pretty common for the client to not be 100 percent satisfied - and to make additional requests and clarifications to the creative professional, resulting in increasingly long email chains, time spent on a single project, and work on the creative professional's part. Thinking on a broader scale, these inefficiencies would hinder the ability of any creative concierge product to scale to larger	degrees.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Less user control = Less creative involvement </b>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Past HCI work has shown that giving control leads to greater feelings of creative empowerment and involvement. In a transactional-based platform at a company whose biggest commodity is creativity, how do we preserve feelings of creative control and empowerment?
            </p>

            <p>
                So - if we constrain communication to a one-way communication (i.e. someone makes a request, someone fulfills the request, and that's it), how much control can we give to users such that they feel 1) satisfied and 2) creatively	empowered?
            </p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                How can we maximize	usersâ€™ creative	empowerment and	satisfaction in a one-way communication system?	
            </div>
            
            <h3>Experiment 1</h3>
            
            <p>
                Through a combination of focus groups and personal experiences, I identified a general process that requesters (i.e. people who make requests for creative products) follow:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><b>Pre-request:</b> typically, there's some sort of form involved. The user chooses whatever it is they want to be fulfilled, uploads necessary photos, types in comments, etc. before hitting "request" or	"submit"</li>
                <li><b>Request:</b> the point at which the "request" button is clicked</li>
                <li><b>Post-request:</b> the point at which the request has been made and the creative professional fulfills it</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                The first question I set out to answer was how the timing of control affected users' satisfaction and feelings of creativity, if at	all.
            </p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                How does giving no control v.s. control before v.s. after a request impact users' satisfaction and creative empowerment?
            </div>
            
            <p>
                To answer this question, I programmed up a simple web page with the following flow:
            </p>
            
            <img src="../images/adobe1.png" style="width: 100%;">
            
            <p>
                Upon selecting one of four pre-chosen photos and an effect to apply to it, users would be directed to one of four different	pages:
            </p>
            
            <ol type="a"> 
                <li><b>No control:</b> Users receive the final edited image with the effect at 100%	intensity </li>
                <li><b>Pre-request control: </b>Users choose the intensity of the image prior to it being returned</li>
                <li><b>Post-request discrete control: </b>Users receive several edited images at varying intensities and choose the one that they prefer</li>
                <li><b>Post-request continuous control:</b> Users receive the final edited image along with a slider to change the intensity	level</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
                At the end of the webpage, users answered statements by showing their agreement with statements like "The image looked exactly how I expected it to look" and "I am creative" in Likert type	format:
            </p>
            
            <img src="../images/adobe2.png" style="width: 100%;">
            
            <p>
                I put the website on Amazon Mechanical Turk and gathered results from approximately 350 subjects over the course of several	days.
            </p>
            
            <H3>Experiment 1 Results</H3>
            
            <p>
                I observed three key things: 
            </p>
            
            <ol> 
                <li>Any control > no control to increase satisfaction</li> 
                <li>Any control > no control to meet users' expectations</li>
                <li>Any control > no control to increase feelings of control and creative involvement </li>
            </ol>
